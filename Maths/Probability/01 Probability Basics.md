Possibility of x event occurring is,
$P(x) = no of possibilities of x / total no of possibilities$

Ex:- Probability of tails
Possibility of side of the coin be tails is 1 and total number of possibilities are 2.
$P(t) = 1 / 2 = 0.5$

## Rules of probability

- Probability of any and every event falls between 0 and 1
$0 \geqslant P(x) \leqslant 1$
- When you add up all the possibilities of all the different outcomes of a certain event, the result is always equal to 1
$P(x) + P(y) + P(z)  = 1$
- When a probability of something happening and probability of something not happening (complement of the event) is added, it must equal one
$P(x) + P(x)^c = 1$
