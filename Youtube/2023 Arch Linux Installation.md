| GUID Partition Table                       	| MBR Partition Table                                      	|
| 9 Zettabytes of storage (9 Ã— 10^9 TB)      	| 2TB-16TB (with Advanced Format) of storage               	|
| 128 Primary partitions                     	| 4 Primary partitions                                     	|

# Changing MBR to GPT

- Change from Legacy boot mode (BIOS) to UEFI in firmware (You will **NOT** be able to boot to existing OSes after this) 
- Change the partition table from scratch to be GPT (data will be **ERASED**)

# Dual Booting

- Create a partition for new Arch Linux system beforehand if a dedicated storage drive is not available

---

# Pre-requisites

- Internet connection
- Pen drive 4GB
