# What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions are packaged scripts to automate tasks in a software-development
workflow in GitHub. You can configure GitHub Actions to trigger complex
workflows that meet your organization's needs; each time developers check new
source code into a specific branch, at timed intervals, or manually. The result
is a reliable and sustainable automated workflow, which leads to a significant
decrease in development time.
