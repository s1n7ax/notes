- Head
   - Head is a pointer to the current commit

- Featch
   - When fetching, git creates a new branch called 'remotes/<remote>/<branch>'
	 and gets the changes from the remote branch

- Fast forward merge
   - When there is a clean commit history without any conflicts, it's a fast
	 forward merge

- Submodules
   - Sub modules only tracks the remote repository and the head pointer
   - When the head pointer changes, the root repository will show that the
	sub module has been changed
   - Git will never change a sub module for you
